# 3d model

There are two versions of the 3d model.
The first version is modeled by `bot-parts.scad` and `print.scad` files.
It is a more robust and "armored" version.

The second version is modelled by the files with `-light` suffix.
It is a more light version.
It uses less material so is possible to print it in lesser time and all the pieces can fit on the plate of our 3d printer.
